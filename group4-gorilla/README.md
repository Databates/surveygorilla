Team Dynamic

On Friday we split into two groups, Cameron and Marco building the activerecord database and Ian, Dan, and Pablo setting up the skeleton for the routes and beginnning development of our views. After this phase of development we split off individually to work on different parts of the project for the remainder of the weekend. Dan focused mostly on JQuery, Marco on CSS presentation, Ian on the Views and routing, and Cameron on Database CRUD and bugfix(...until he got sick). 



Git Workflow

We probably need to increase the frequency of our commits. Every couple of hours we would each rebase and merge into master in turn so that we could stay up to date and verify the accuracy of our trello board.

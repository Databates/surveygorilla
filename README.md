### Team Dynamic

On Friday we built wireframes and an MVP list then split into two groups. Cameron and Marco building the activerecord database and Ian, Dan, and Pablo setting up the skeleton for the routes and beginnning development of our views. After this phase of development we paired on and off to work on different parts of the project for the remainder of the weekend. Dan took lead on much of the form building JQuery, Marco lead presentation layer and page-specific AJAX, Ian cranked on views, routes, and getting shit done. Cameron worked on database CRUD and bugfixes(...until he got sick). Pablo paired with each of us throughout the project to help build his skills.


### Git Workflow

We probably need to increase the frequency of our commits. Things got better toward the end but it was a rough start. Every couple of hours we would each rebase and merge into master in turn so that we could stay up to date and verify the accuracy of our trello board.

Trello become more useful towards the end for tracking the smaller tasks. Wireframes were used in the beginning though not fully developed. User stories were something always on our mind but never written down. Writing user stories this morning, we know in hindsight that we would have been more on point and able to tackled more.

### Summary

We're excited about our project and had lots of fun. Things crept up along the way, some we overlooked, others we never thought of. While there's room for improvement (there always is), we're proud of the work we have and now have a better understanding of group dynamics and project building.
